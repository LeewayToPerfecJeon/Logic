    //2-1. so check if the number is related to the other players 
    //2-2. should I take the number if the number is small enough? just to mess the other player up? 
    //cause if they're waiting for a number that's in between two numbers it's like HA screw you now you can never make it consecutive
    //+3. are there enough chips in the pool to just take the number?
    //3-1. is there a possibility that this number has consecutive numbers that have not come out yet?
    //3-2. ..?
